What still on error:
1. in FirebaseRepositoryImpl, in function getPsychologistData, firebase give ArrayList but specializations and experiences accept SnapshotStateList
   this makes the psychologistState in PatientHomePage emptyList()

What should be done:
1. Fixing the type mismatch in FirebaseRepositoryImpl
2. Complete the nav bar in PatientHomeScreen
3. Complete navigation for each component in PatientHomeScreen
